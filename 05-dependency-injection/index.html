        <h1>Dependency Injection Demo</h1>
			  <p>Dependency injection is an example of what we may call <em>inversion of control</em>. It's a design pattern that allows us to decouple the creation of objects from their dependencies. This is useful for modifiability and maintenance.</p>

			  <p>In this demo, we'll use dependency injection to create a web component that uses a different storage implementations. We'll also use a factory to create the storage implementation.

        <!-- eventually we could make to add a new one with a Rest endpoint.  You may want to use json-server and do a simple local backend for that. The JSON server could allow us to mock the end point before we commit to it.  What ility improvments would we have using the REST endpoint, what might we lose? -->
